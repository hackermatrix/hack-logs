# The Blast Radius: Limiting Over-Privileged Service Accounts in AWS\n\n# Introduction: The Silent Threat of Over-Privilege\n\nIn a modern cloud environment, automated service accounts—such as AWS IAM Roles—are the backbone of operations. They perform everything from managing databases to deploying new infrastructure. However, they represent one of the most critical security blind spots: the over-privileged account. When compromised, a service account with overly broad permissions becomes a "blast radius" with the potential to destroy entire cloud environments.\n\n## The Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)\n\nThe foundation of secure IAM is the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP). This mandates that every user, process, or service account be given only the permissions absolutely necessary to perform its task, and no more. Violating PoLP leads to privilege creep, where roles accumulate unused permissions over time.\n\nA common violation looks like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  "Effect": "Allow",\n  "Action": "s3:*",\n  "Resource": "*"\n}\n```\n\nGranting `s3:*` to an account that only needs to read a single bucket is an immediate security debt. A compromise instantly allows an attacker to manipulate every S3 bucket in the account.\n\n## Technical Solutions for Mitigation\n\nLimiting the blast radius requires automation and continuous auditing:\n\n1.  **IAM Access Analyzer:** Utilize this built-in AWS tool to identify roles that have been granted access to external entities or that have unused high-risk permissions.\n2.  **Condition Keys:** Enforce guardrails by adding conditions to policies. For instance, restrict an action to occur only when the request originates from a specific VPC or uses Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).\n\n    ```json\n    "Condition": {\n        "StringEquals": {\n            "aws:RequestedRegion": "us-east-1"\n        }\n    }\n    ```\n\n3.  **Role Session Duration:** For roles assumed by applications, use a shorter maximum session duration. If the account is compromised, the attacker's window of opportunity is limited.\n\nThe effort required to implement PoLP is small compared to the catastrophic consequences of a zero-day exploit leveraging a single, over-privileged service account.
