# Welcome to Hrishikesh's Security Logs

This space hosts my notes on cybersecurity, CTF writeups, exploit development, blue team pipelines, incident response, and small tools that made life easier.

> Stay curious. Hack ethically.

## What to expect

- Short, focused writeups you can run in your own lab
- Commands and configs inline so you can copy/paste
- Links to proof-of-concepts when possible

## Conventions

- Commands are in code blocks
- Screens/outputs are quoted
- Tags help you filter quickly

```bash
# Example: enumerate open ports fast
sudo nmap -T4 -Pn -p- 10.10.11.123
```

## Navigation

- Use the search bar to find posts by keyword or CVE
- Filter by tags like `ctf`, `recon`, `blue-team`, `linux`
- Click "Random" when you just want something new

See you in the next post.
