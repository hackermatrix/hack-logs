# Blog Content Ground Rules (for Automated & Generated Content)

This document establishes the minimum quality, style, and structural requirements for any blog post published to the `hack-logs` repository, especially when drafted or processed by the automation agent.

## 1. Quality & Tone

| Rule | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Tone** | **Direct, technical, and analytical.** Avoid excessive motivational language, fluff, or overly complex metaphors. The voice should be that of a knowledgeable security professional. |
| **Theme** | **Cybersecurity, GRC, Cloud, and Hacking.** All content must be relevant to these core themes. |
| **Accuracy** | Information must be technically accurate and verifiable. If an opinion is stated, it must be clearly framed as such. |
| **Engagement** | Posts should aim to break down complex topics into clear, consumable sections. |

## 2. Structure & Formatting

| Rule | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Title** | Must be clear, informative, and engaging. Should be unique to the topic. |
| **Headings** | Use proper Markdown hierarchy (`#` for H1/Title, `##` for main sections, `###` for sub-sections). |
| **Code Blocks** | All code, terminal output, or syntax snippets **must** be enclosed in Markdown code blocks (e.g., \`\`\`bash\`, \`\`\`js\`). |
| **Length** | Aim for 500-1500 words. Too short (less than 300) or too long (over 2000) should be avoided. |
| **Lists** | Prefer ordered lists (1., 2., 3.) for steps and bullet points (-) for general concepts. |

## 3. Automation and Metadata

| Rule | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Slug** | Must be generated by the `scripts/auto-post.js` script to ensure correct numbering (`blgN-date-title-slug`). |
| **Metadata** | Posts **must** have a relevant `title`, `description`, and at least two relevant `tags` to be added to `posts.json`. |
| **Cover Image** | If an image cannot be generated, the agent must create a placeholder and note in the commit that the image is missing and needs manual replacement. |

This file must be respected by the agent when assisting with any content generation or drafting tasks.
